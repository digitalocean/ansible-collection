        **Thank you for wanting to suggest a feature for `digitalocean.cloud`!**


        Verify first that your idea is not [already requested on
        GitHub][issue search].

        Also test if the `main` branch does not already implement this.

      description: >
        Describe the new feature/improvement you would like briefly below.

        What's the problem this feature will solve?

        What are you trying to do, that you are unable to achieve
        with `digitalocean.cloud` as it currently stands?

        * Provide examples of real-world use cases that this would enable
        and how it solves the problem you described.

        * How do you solve this now?

        * Have you tried to work around the problem using other tools?

        * Could there be a different approach to solving this issue?

      placeholder: >-
        I am trying to do X with `digitalocean.cloud` from the `main` branch on GitHub and
        I think that implementing a feature Y would be very helpful for me and
        every other user of `digitalocean.cloud` because of Z.

          We would do it by ourselves but unfortunatelly, the curent
          edition of GitHub Issue Forms Alpha does not support this yet 🤷


          _We will make it easier in the future, once GitHub
          supports dropdown defaults. Promise!_
