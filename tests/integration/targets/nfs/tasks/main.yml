# NFS integration tests are currently disabled due to extremely slow provisioning times
# (30+ minutes to hours) and resources getting stuck in CREATING state indefinitely.
# The module code has been improved with proper timeout handling and error detection,
# but the tests cannot run reliably until the DigitalOcean NFS backend is more stable.
#
# See aliases file for disabled status.
