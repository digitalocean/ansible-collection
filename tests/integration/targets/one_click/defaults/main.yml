# NOTE: It's a bit expensive to fire up K8s just for this module, so, we'll
# just test check mode and failure (with an unknown cluster UUID). The DO
# API doesn't give us very much here likely because testing K8s testing
# applications is so complex and variable. If we get a 200 back from the API
# we should also have a message "Successfully kicked off addon job."
